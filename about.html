A little about me:
My name is Sharon. I’m a widow and a proud mom to one amazing son. Over the years, our journey has taken us across different places — most recently from Dallas, Texas back home to Michigan, where we’re staying for now with a close family friend. Life on the move has taught me resilience, flexibility, and how to adapt quickly, which are skills I now carry into my work.

I’ve spent years working as an independent contractor in phone-based customer service and political survey interviewing. While I value the experience, I’m ready to transition into the next chapter: remote, non-phone work. That’s why I'm actively studying web development. I’m genuinely enjoying the process of learning to code and building projects from scratch, and I look forward to applying these skills in real-world projects as I grow in this field.
